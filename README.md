The purpose of this little project is to build a basic platform
where I can experiment with the ability of an LLM to generate queries,
issue searches against a bibliographic database, and
interpret the results. The idea is to use a chatbot as a way to quickly
explore and prototype prompts and models that might support different types
of library applications like cataloging, collection analysis, resource sharing, etc.

I'm incredibly rusty as a developer and know no
Python, so please don't judge.

**Prerequisites**

YAZGPT.py needs to zee "zoomsh" in its path.
Zoomsh is part of the
[YAZ toolkit](https://www.indexdata.com/resources/software/yaz). You can easily
find it for almost any platform.

You need an OpenAI API key. The code looks for it in the
OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.

**TODO**

Break initial prompt into a file and make the file a commmand line option to allow tuning of the prompt to the
use case.

Add logging of query/result details for auditing the results

Refine the mapping of records. Is it possible to give access to additional fields/detailed records
on demand?

Would it make sense to predefine multiple search targets and let the LLM choose the modst appropriate one?

Explore use cases: General research, copy cataloging, resource sharing

List remaining context buffer space; add some kind of cleanout/compression of older messages.
